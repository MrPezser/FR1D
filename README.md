Looking the the Flux Reconstruction method of H.T. Huynh for solving the 1D Advection Equation or 1D Euler Equations. Currently have capability for N-D solutions of radau polynomials based about lobatto points.

Some experimentation with modifications to the correction procedure have been explored placing this in the research code category. (meaning it don't work but kinda does if you ask nicely)
